# odin-recipes

This is my first project in The Odin Project. It is about creating basic HTML pages with a recipes theme.
So far, as I had learned a bit of HTML before, I take the learnings on command line and Git as the most precious. They are proving to be invaluable.
I learned mostly how to organize my page's content, use Git for submitting changes, commenting on each commit, and share with others via Github.

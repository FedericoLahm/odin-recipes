    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I might be biased but I have tried different types of pasties from all over the world, and I still think that the Argentinian empanadas are the best.</p>
    <p>So simple, so delicious and ideal to just snack comfortably, alone, with family and/or friends.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500 gr of ground beef</li>
            <li>500 gr of onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 glass of red wine</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons smoked paprika</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>Fresh cilantro or parsley</li>
            <li>1 pack of circular puff pastry</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a big pan, heat up the oil.</li>
            <li>Add the onion and cook until translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the beef and cook until brown.</li>
            <li>Add the glass of red wine and let the alcohol steam out, as explained in our <a href="./lentil-stew.html">lentil stew</a> recipe.</li>
            <li>Add the spices and mix well.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and leave to cool off until room temperature.</li>
            <li>Put a bit of the mixture in the circular puff pastry dough (for another recipe) and close it down as shown in the picture (or with a fork).</li>
            <li>Turn on the oven on 220°C until hot, and place the closed up empanadas on a tray. Optionally you can paint them with egg yolk for a golden color.</li>
            <li>Wait around 12 minutes and they will be ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
